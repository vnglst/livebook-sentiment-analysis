# Sentiment analysis using Livebook and Bumblebee

After @josevalim@genserver.social's impressive demo of Elixir Bumblebee I gave the neural networks a chance in Livebook. 
It's pretty amazing how easy it is to get started.

This is a sentiment analysis of Jos√© Valim's most recent toots. Yes, he's a pretty positive guy!
